# The sites ads234.com and ads345.com -- These sites hijack internet explorer 
# and redirect all requests through their servers. You may need to use spyware 
# removal programs such as SpyBotS&D, AdAware or HijackThis to remove this 
# nasty parasite. It's possible that blocking these sites using a hosts file 
# may not work, in which case you should remove the following lines from this
# file and try the tools listed above immediately. Don't forget to reboot 
# after a scan.
